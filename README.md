## Convert .MOD to the Pico-8 format

The purpose of this project is to create a small-ish script (or set of scripts) that can convert a .MOD file to the Pico-8 cartridge format. The idea is that there will be a set of template .MODs that can be used to create cartridges with a certain set of sounds.
